		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I am a Media Planner,living in Hong Kong. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to redesign my blog and instead of using an existing template I want to build it completely on my own.</p>

		<h3>My Mission</h3>
				
		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day become a professional web designer that communicate well with web developers and produce websites that can answer client&#39;s needs and at the same time, impactful and user-friendly. </p>

		<h3>My Experience</h3>

		<p>This is how I&#39;ve evolved professionally:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Media Planner</strong>, Carat Media Hong Kong<br>
			<em>Hong Kong</em>, 2013-14</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other</h3>
